Builder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.
Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

Identification: 
    The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object.
Director:
    Extracting a series of calls to the builder steps to construct a product into a separate class called director. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.
