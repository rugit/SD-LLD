## About

Understanding and applying design patterns is a crucial aspect of writing maintainable and scalable code. This repository aims to provide examples of well-known design patterns in three popular programming languages: Java, Python, and TypeScript.

## Implemented Patterns

The following design patterns are currently implemented:

- [Singleton Pattern](#singleton-pattern)
- [Observer Pattern](#observer-pattern)
- [Factory Method Pattern](#factory-method-pattern)
- [... (Add more as you implement)]

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-playground.git```

   ````

2. Explore the implemented design patterns in each respective directory.

Usage
Each design pattern is organized into its own directory. Navigate to the specific pattern directory to find detailed examples and explanations for that pattern in the chosen programming language.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the code in your projects. If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest, please open an issue or create a pull request.
