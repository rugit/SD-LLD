SINGLETON
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.
Instance of the object cannot be created, so hide the constructor.
Client can access the instance through a function of the class, so the function should be static.
The function will create the instance and store it in a static member variable of the class.
For eager loading, the instance can be initialized when the class is created.
